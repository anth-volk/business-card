# Business Card Repo

Welcome to the repo for my digital business card, hosted as a branch of my personal website. 
This project was inspired by an early-stage React tutorial project, but with a couple important feature inclusions aimed at making sharing contact information as easy as possible:

1. Generating a static QR code that points to this business card so that the code can easily be printed on physical business cards and/or shared via messaging apps
1. Including a "save contact information" button that allows mobile users to seamlessly save the card's contact info to their mobile devices

The latter was far easier to do than expected by creating a vCard (.vcf) file online and simply embedding a download link to the file in the "Add contact" button on the webpage, while a variety of tools exist online to generate a static QR code.
